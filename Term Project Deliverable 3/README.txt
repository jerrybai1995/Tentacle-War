This game, named the "TENTACLE WAR," is a strategic game that the user/player will try to come up with a strategic plan
to assimilate enemy cells. The enemy cells are controlled by AI, and they will also be able to attack, defense, assist
and call for their friendly cells for help. The whole game has 7 levels. The user's data can be saved the loaded, and 
statistics can be viewed in "Achievement."

While this game is a bit complicated, to run it is not an extremely difficult task. The module I use is pygame, which can 
be downloaded from 
https://www.pygame.org

The version for pygame should be 1.9.1 or 1.9.2, which are for Python 2.7. You can get Python 2.7 from
https://www.python.org/downloads/
 
This project also includes the use of module such as pickle, but that is installed along with Python 2.7. In the folder,
you will find "TPFinal.py." Double-click to run it and the game will start.

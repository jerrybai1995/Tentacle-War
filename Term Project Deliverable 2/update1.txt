Updates from Term Project Deliverable 1:

1. Tentacles can now transport signals that affect the target's life value
2. The program is able to identify tentacle cut
3. Tentacle can be divided into two parts: one collapsing to the target and one to the parent cell
4. User Interface added: Main Menu, Help, Level Chosen, Background, "LEVEL COMPLETE" interface, Re-play, etc.
5. The user is able to freely go back to main menu, and before playing they can choose background
6. Artificial Intelligence. The enemy cell takes a relatively advaced algorithm (possibly I will update further next week) that I designed
	such that their moves are based on simple FSM (Finite State Machine) principle. Priority Queue is used. Computer will determine the
	state of the enemy cell; but after they are assimilated, they are controlled by the user, and enemy-color tentacles gradually collapse.
7. Music is added to the game (put headphones!)
8. Available and Unavailable state: based on the progress of the user, some levels are cleared but those that are not complete are temporarily 
	unavailable.
8. Simple save and load function. This will be improved further, but now we are able to save at any time by pressing "s" and read previous record
	by pressing "space" key.
